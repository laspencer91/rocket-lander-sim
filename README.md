C++ Rocket Lander Simulation Using a PID Controller For Adjustment

This project was an excersise in strengthing my C++ knowledge and intuition, in combination with exploring some concepts of control systems and rocket stablization. AI was not utilized, so this project represents my thinking (at the time of writing) toward code architecture in modeling a simulated space and objects within it.

I lost steam and motivation on the project else I would have done a second pass to clean up some aspects of the codebase, like creating a more consistent file pattern; there are some files that contain multiple classes where you may not expect. This can make it more difficult to reason about than need be. And it could have probably been solved in the time it has taken me to write this paragraph. But so be it, the insanity of being human.
